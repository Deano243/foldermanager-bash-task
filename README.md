# Bash File Reader & Search Script

A simple Bash script that:

- Reads a text file line by line and prints its content
- Returns the total number of lines, words, and file size
- Accepts a search term and checks if it exists in the file
- If found, displays its position (e.g., "word num 455")
- Prints the full content of the file after the search
